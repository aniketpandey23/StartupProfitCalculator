# StartupProfitCalculator
The dataset used contains the details of 50 startups based in New York, California and Florida.
Suppose you work in an investment firm as an analyst so you need to predict the the profit that the startups are going to earn based on their budget and what will be the main factor to achieve maximum profit.
To solve this problem, I have used Python Programming language. 
To compute the factor affecting profit, backward elimination method and select a significance level. If the p-value is above the significant level, we will eliminate that predictor.
The deployment of this model can be done using Azure ml studio (classic).
